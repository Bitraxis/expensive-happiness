My own configs that I use, **HEAVILY** relies on installation of catppuccin-mocha

## A Note for Catppuccin
- It's cool and I like it
- Please don't kill me if the licensing is wrong

# I want to use this!
First off, you don't... 

- What you need to make everything to work correctly (QT):
1. Install and set up [Darkly](https://github.com/Bali10050/Darkly) = for qt
2. Catppuccin-mocha-lavender is alredy installed in qt5ct and qt6ct so just install those programs and set them up correctly so you'll see the theme
- What you need to make GTK work **(Warning as of 2024 Catppuccin no longer _officially_ supports GTK!)**:
1. Install [Catppuccin-GTK](https://github.com/catppuccin/gtk) = Mocha-lavender in my config is used so just install it
2. GTK-3 theme is set up in my sway config
4. GTK-4 theme should be set up as per [Tutorial](https://github.com/brycewalkerdev/catppuccin-gtk) i provide the gtk-4.0 directory but what I read you should make your own as I heard it relies on the symbolic linking
- Other thing you'll need:
1. Papirus-icon-theme and paper-icon-theme available in your distros repository
2. Qt5ct and Qt6ct
- If you are feeling frisky:
1. Set up all themes to work in flatpak as you want
